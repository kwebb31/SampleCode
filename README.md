# SampleCode
Some small segments of sample code
There will be several segments of code, some in Python but most  in C++. The majority of the code I've written so far has been in C++, but I've also helped to teach people to code in Python, with moderate python skills. I'm experienced with Pointers, Learning Object Oriented Programming, and have experience with data structures. Thanks for your time and patience reviewing my code! 

The code is a mix of given code from past assignments and my code - my code has comments on it labelling it as my code. Thank you!
